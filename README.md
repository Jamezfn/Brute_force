Here's a clean, no-BS `README.md` for your LeetCode repo where you're solving problems using both **brute force** and **optimized algorithms**:

# LeetCode Solutions: Brute Force & Optimized Approaches

Welcome to my LeetCode grind 💪.  
This repo contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems using:

- ✅ Brute force (first idea, raw logic)
- ⚡ Optimized algorithms (greedy, two pointers, DP, etc.)

The goal is to learn **by comparison** — see how naive logic scales vs proper algorithmic thinking.

---

## 🔧 Structure

Each problem is in its own folder like:

```

/01-two-sum
\- brute.py
\- optimized.py
\- README.md (optional explanation)

````

---

## 🚀 Why This Repo?

- Practice clean code under constraints
- Build intuition by **starting naive** and **improving**
- Document growth from raw to refined thinking
- Help others struggling with the same questions

---

## 💡 Algorithms I Use

- Brute force (always first to understand problem)
- Greedy
- Two Pointers
- Hashing
- Sliding Window
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- Binary Search
- Graphs, Trees, BFS, DFS, etc. *(as needed)*

---

## 🧠 Problem Sources

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
- Sometimes inspired by mock interviews or real interview prep

---

## 📦 Requirements

Just Python 3. Most files are ready to run as-is:

```bash
python3 brute.py
python3 optimized.py
````

## 🔥 Let’s Level Up!

> Brute force it 'til you can't — then **think smarter**.
> This repo is my journey from **raw logic to clean algorithms.**
