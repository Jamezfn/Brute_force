# LeetCode Solutions: Brute Force & Optimized Approaches

Welcome to my LeetCode grind ðŸ’ª.  
This repo contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems using:

- âœ… Brute force (first idea, raw logic)
- âš¡ Optimized algorithms (greedy, two pointers, DP, etc.)

The goal is to learn **by comparison** â€” see how naive logic scales vs proper algorithmic thinking.

## ðŸ”§ Structure

Each problem is in its own folder like:

```

/12. Integer to Roman
â”œâ”€â”€ brute.py
â”œâ”€â”€ optimized.py
â””â”€â”€ README.md

````

## ðŸš€ Why This Repo?

- Practice clean code under constraints
- Build intuition by **starting naive** and **improving**
- Document growth from raw to refined thinking
- Help others struggling with the same questions

## ðŸ’¡ Algorithms I Use

- Brute force (always first to understand problem)
- Greedy
- Two Pointers
- Hashing
- Sliding Window
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- Binary Search
- Graphs, Trees, BFS, DFS, etc.

## ðŸ§  Problem Sources

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
- Sometimes inspired by mock interviews or real interview prep

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

Just Python 3. Most files are ready to run as-is:

```bash
python3 brute.py
python3 optimized.py
````

## ðŸ™Œ Contributions

This repo is mainly for personal growth, but feel free to fork, copy ideas, or hit me up if you want to collaborate.
